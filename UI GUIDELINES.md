# Tox User Interface Guidelines
======

## Padding

In the mockup, nearly everything is given 10 pixels of space. There are only a few places where this rule is broken, and those are usually for good reason such as to draw attention. This 10 pixel number is not set in stone, but if you're building a UI off of these mockups, I would at the very least appreciate you try to use a uniform padding if you're not going to use 10 pixels exactly.

## Corners

In the process of "teaching" the user how to interact with Tox, we give them a few visual cues that things are clickable. One of them is to use the cue color Tox Green, while the other is to give the clickable object rounded corners. All rounded corners in this mockup have a corner radius of 5 pixels.
